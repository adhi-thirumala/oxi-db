first clone the git repo
```git clone https://github.com/adhi-thirumala/oxi-db.git```

next build the project (make sure that cargo and the rest of the rust toolchain is installed)
```cargo b```

then run the demo in ```main.rs``` with
```cargo run```

look through the methods in ```database.rs``` to find documentation on how to integrate it on your own project.
